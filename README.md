# Dynamic-Pricing-for-Urban-Parking-Lots
This project implements a real-time dynamic parking pricing model that adjusts parking fees based on factors like demand, traffic, queue length, special events, and vehicle type. The goal is to optimize resource usage, reduce congestion, and improve user experience by simulating real-world parking dynamics using streaming data.
# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains real-time data from 14 urban parking lots over 73 days, with 18 time-stamped entries per day (from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM at 30-minute intervals).

Each entry includes:

Location: Latitude & Longitude

Lot Features: Capacity, Current Occupancy, Queue Length

Vehicle Info: Type (Car, Bike, Truck)

Conditions: Traffic Level, Special Day Indicator

This data enables simulation of parking demand fluctuations and pricing decisions across multiple city locations.
